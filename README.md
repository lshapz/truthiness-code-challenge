# Truthiness Code Challenge

## Objectives

1. Strengthen your understanding of truthiness in Ruby
2. Practice using boolean and comparison operators

# Code Challenge

?: Take a look at the code below. We have defined a method, `returning_true` that uses a comparison operator, the `<` (less than) to compare the number 14 to... nothing. What value(s) for `?` will make `returning_true` return `true`?

``` ruby
def returning_true
  14 < ?
end
```

[ ] 1
[x] 15
[ ] 14
[x] 17

?: Here we have a method, `returning_false` that uses both comparison and boolean operators. What value(s) for `?` will make `returning_false` return `false`?

``` ruby
def returning_false
  7 > 4 && 100 < ?
end
```

[x] 100
[ ] 101
[ ] 102
[ ] 103

?: Take a look at the method `using_truthiness` below. What value(s) for `?` will make `using_truthiness` return `false`?

```ruby
def using_truthiness
  7 > 8 || ?
end
```

[x] false
[x] 8 > 9
[x] !true
[ ] 9 < 6

?: What value(s) for `?` will make `using_truthiness` return `true`?

```ruby
def using_truthiness
  7 > 8 || ?
end
```

[x] 7 > 6
[ ] 7
[ ] false
[ ] 8 > 9
